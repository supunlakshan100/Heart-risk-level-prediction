    <p>What is Flask?
        Flask is a web application framework written in Python. 
        It was developed by Armin Ronacher, who led a team of international Python enthusiasts called Poocco. 
        Flask is based on the Werkzeg WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine.Both are Pocco projects.

        WSGI
        The Web Server Gateway Interface (Web Server Gateway Interface, WSGI) has been used as a standard for Python web application development.
        WSGI is the specification of a common interface between web servers and web applications.

        Werkzeug
        Werkzeug is a WSGI toolkit that implements requests, response objects, and 
        utility functions. This enables a web frame to be built on it. The Flask 
        framework uses Werkzeg as one of its bases.</p>
